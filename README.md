# Classroom Samples Repository

This repository will be updated weekly as I go thru demos during class.  I'll push all the code that I work thru in class up to this repository for everyone to see.  You'll have access to review/clone/pull from the repository as needed.

As always, feel free to reference the book's sample code using the author's GitHub repository for the book located at https://github.com/danhermes/xamarin-book-examples

Midterm exam is 2/28/2019
